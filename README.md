### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jessica, a mental and public health data scientist.

I currently work for the UK Health Security Agency, and previously worked as a psychiatric researcher at King's College London. As most of my projects use confidential data, they cannot be published online. Therefore I will only be updating this GitHub in the rare instances where the data I use are publically available.
